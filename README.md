# Introduction
An introduction to New Entity Operations Inc.

New Entity Operations Inc. develops novelty software libraries and brings advanced human-to-machine interface technologies to market.

The company organizes fragmented canonical-focused software components and assembles them into vertical local-first AI-enabled product lines. These software projects include an operating system for general-purpose computing, human-to-machine software interfaces, robotics control systems, information-scoping aides, and various web3 protocols. Together, these modular and independent products are able to be assembled into a new type of entity-based computer system. The assembled systems enhance the capabilities of the operator and augments their natural cognitive abilities.

These systems were developed by self-funded and independent technologist without using outside labor or capital.

Our work was made possible by the efforts of New Entity Operations, LLC with the goal of returning autonomy and control back to the individuals building the World Wide Web. We're enabling creators, self-sovereign minded individuals, and compassionate robots to move society towards a less judgemental - yet constructive future. Together we're able to work on and solve difficult problems, overcome adversity, experience joy, and learn more about others. We can do this both through technology and by working on improving our shared humanity. Alone, we're able to develop our own sense of strength and responsibility - building our own ideas and cultivating our unique gifts - while together, we're able to share in them as a common people.
